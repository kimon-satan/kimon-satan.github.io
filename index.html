			<h1>Hi there, I'm Simon Katan</h1>
			<p>
				I’m a digital artist with a background in music and a strong preoccupation with games and play.
				My work incorporates hidden mechanisms, emergent behaviour, paradox, self-reference, inconsistency, abstract humour, absurdity and wonder.
				I make software which creates musical odysseys through exploring animated worlds and design games in which the players unwittingly become performers of bizarre and occasionally daft rites.
				I completed a PhD researching audio-visual co-dependency in music at Brunel University in 2012 and won a Prix Ars Electronica Honorary Mention for my work ‘Cube with Magic Ribbons'. I have performed, composed, and resided extensively in the UK and Europe. Recent organisations include The Roundhouse (London), Tyneside Cinema (Newcastle), IEM (Graz), and ZKM (Karlsruhe). I lecture in computing and have been head of Creative Computing at Goldsmiths University since 2015.
