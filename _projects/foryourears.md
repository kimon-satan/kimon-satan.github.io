<div class="projectIntro">
For Your Ears Only is a hi-tech listening game which was commissioned for the BFI James Bond weekender in May 2009 as part of Hide and Seek's Sandpit. Players attempt to deactivate a ticking bomb in the heart of London by listening to satellite communication signals - actually circuit bent noise taken from Luke Fraser's aaa1cabs - on mp3 players. By finding matching tracks and entering the numbers into a control interface they can disable the satellites and prevent immanent disaster. The catch is that all the tracks are unlabelled and jumbled up and the players aren't allowed to swap headphones - weird descriptions and bizarre singing ensues.
