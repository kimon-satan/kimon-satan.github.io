<div class="projectIntro">
Clamour is an interactive mixed media theatre piece for live coder and audience. It tells the story of Sealand – a lone outpost surrounded by vast swathes of ocean. In the aftermath of a global catastrophe its people collaborate to forge a new future.
<br><br>
Experienced simultaneously via audience smartphones and the events unfolding onstage, Clamour wryly and reflexively interrogates how technology and social media mediate and influence information, relationships, and identities.
<br><br>
Clamour was funded by Arts Council England – Grants for the Arts. The first performance took place in the Sackler Space at The Roundhouse, London on 22 November 2018.
