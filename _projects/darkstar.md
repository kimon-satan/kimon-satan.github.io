<div class="projectIntro">
Dark Star is an interactive multimedia installation which I produced during my six week residency at Mota in Ljubljana. The projection screen is actually a dark plexi-glass hemisphere suspended in mid-air using nylon chord.

Onlookers interact with the installation by pointing at a particular star which then grows and reveals its own individual characteristic. Eventually there will be hundreds of different stars each with their own sound and graphics but currently there are only five which can be seen here.
The project uses SuperCollider, OpenFrameworks and a Kinect for the tracking.
