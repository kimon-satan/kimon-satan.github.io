<div class="projectIntro">
Sleuth is a series of gamified code puzzles, designed around an introductory computer programming curriculum with a film-noir detective story theme. Puzzles are procedurally generated and auto-graded through an online platform, themed as the detective agency ‘Sleuth & Co’. Guided by the ‘Chief,’ students download puzzles and upload them for grading. Playing a rookie detective, they gain experience points and unlock adventures by solving code crimes. The game was developed as a key part of the Introduction to Programming module on University of London World Wide's BSc Computer Science programme. Since launch over 3000 students have used Sleuth to learn to code.
