<div class="projectIntro">
Spidersonics is a free iPad app designed to enable young people of all ages and abilities to get creative with sound. Recording and playing sounds is easy, but you can also change them in lots of exciting ways by touching the screen, tilting the iPad or moving around. The app is designed for workshops and participatory music sessions. It was created using OpenFrameworks and the Maximillian audio library.
<br><br>
The app was developed through a process of co-creation instigated by Dr. Mick Grierson in the Computing Department at Goldsmiths, University of London, with Whitefield School, St Francis School in Lincoln and Linwood School in Bournemouth. In addition, the core creative and development team consisted of Dr Chris Kiefer, Dr Simon Katan, Composer Duncan Chapman, and Designer Myah Chun, with production by Becca Laurence.
<br><br>
The project was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and soundandmusic.org.
