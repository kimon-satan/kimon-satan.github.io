<div class="projectIntro">
Adventures in Wonderland is a site-specific adventure game designed to teach undergraduate computing students essential peripheral skills such as file management and version control. Students began their adventure by downloading a simple text file called README and following instructions from a character called Rabbit. As the course progresses so does the complexity scale of the tasks, culminating in a photo adventure trail to a hidden escape room - the Mad Hatter's lair.
