<div class="projectIntro">
Introduction to Programming is an online course teaching students the fundamentals of code using a creative approach supported by the <a href="http://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5js</a> framework. It was developed for the Goldsmiths / University of London Online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london" target="_blank">BSc in Computer Science</a> but a truncated version also runs as a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-computer-programming" target="_blank">MOOC</a>.
<br><br>
The course, developed by Dr Edward Anstead and myself features innovative features including <a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/www/118/" target="_blank">The Game Project</a>, where students each build their own side-scroller game over a series of scaffolded assignments, and <a href="/projects/sleuth.html" target="_blank">Sleuth</a>, a film noir detective themed game where students learn to code through solving code crimes. Students are encouraged to "learn by hacking" as well as "coding from scratch" through creative challenges spread throughout the course.

To date, there have been over 14000 MOOC enrolments, and  over 1200 degree enrolments with an average rating of 4.5/5.
