<div class="projectIntro">
Romeoke is a sound responsive game for two players combining avant-garde karaoke with retro arcade gameplay, and archery. Two knights battle it out to win the love of their sweet maiden by charming her with heart shaped balloons. These are created by singing sweet melodies to inflate and send them floating gently up to her balcony. Less gallant players might also shoot down their rivalâ€™s balloons by singing short notes with sharp attacks to fire arrows.
<br><br>
The game is built using a combination of SuperCollider for the machine listening and OpenFrameworks for the graphical interface and was played at the Hide and Seek Sandpit 06/12 and the Weekender 09/12. Artwork was by Sara Gelfgren, and voice effects by Adam de la Cour.
