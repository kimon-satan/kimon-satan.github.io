<div class="projectIntro">
‘Where am I?’ is a dancedigital commission, created by Marguerite Galizia in collaboration with Simon Katan and performed by Daniel Watson. The project was funded by the National Lottery through the Arts Council England. The piece was performed at Resolution Festival in 2014 to critical acclaim. For this project I developed a depth tracking application using OpenFrameworks and SuperCollider. Working with the choreographer in rehearsals I designed the interaction and sonic feedback which largely consists of granular synthesis of recorded voice and paper.
